Life is like an onion, you peel off one layer at a time and sometimes you weep..
Life is just a phase you're going through...You'll get over it.
Life is divided into the horrible and the miserable..
Life doesn't imitate art, it imitates bad television..
Life is as tedious as a twice told tale vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man..
Life is like a speeding meteor that looks beautiful across the dark skies until it suddenly could fall to hit you by..
Be cautioned of the facts of life..
A life being dreamed is wonderful, but to experience it, there are things so horrible..
I wish you well in life..! Live, laugh, love, cry, drink, eat, burp and fart....
