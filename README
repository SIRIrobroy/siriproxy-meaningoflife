Meaning of Life Siri Proxy Plugin
---------------------------------

This plugin overrides the default "What is the meaning of life?" responses by Apple servers.

It loads the file mol.txt in the plugin directory and picks a random quote to say to the user.

Speech pattern is very general. It will match any phrase containing the words "meaning of life".

Have fun!
